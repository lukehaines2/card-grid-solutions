## Flexbox VS CSS Grid - Investigation for info cards

Addressing flexbox grid issue, playing with compromised flex solution, and the obviously superior css grid solution.

## Quick demo below

It should be fairly clear from this gif that the best possible flexbox solution (which includes a disgn compromise) is sub optimal when compared to the CSS Grid solution for this use case. Key points are the consistent grid gaps/gutters and the built in breakpoint behaviour that required no media queries. The grid solution requires just 3 lines of code!!
